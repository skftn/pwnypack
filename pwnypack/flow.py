"""
The Flow module lets you connect to processes or network services using a
unified API. It is primarily designed for synchronous communication flows.

It is based around the central :class:`Flow` class which uses a ``Channel``
to connect to a process. The :class:`Flow` class then uses the primitives
exposed by the ``Channel`` to provide a high level API for reading/receiving
and writing/sending data.


Examples:
    >>> from pwny import *
    >>> f = Flow.connect_tcp('ced.pwned.systems', 80)
    >>> f.writelines([
    ...     b'GET / HTTP/1.0',
    ...     b'Host: ced.pwned.systems',
    ...     b'',
    ... ])
    >>> line = f.readline().strip()
    >>> print(line == b'HTTP/1.0 200 OK')
    True
    >>> f.until(b'\\r\\n\\r\\n')
    >>> f.read_eof(echo=True)
    ... lots of html ...

    >>> from pwny import *
    >>> f = Flow.execute('cat')
    >>> f.writeline(b'hello')
    >>> f.readline(echo=True)
